Rikaapi is a cozy dine-in restaurant that serves a variety of delicious dishes and beverages to its customers. It does not provide online delivery or takeaway services, and the main goal of this project is to create a simple and attractive front-end website that represents the restaurant. The website will allow visitors to view the restaurant’s menu with item names, descriptions, and prices, learn about the restaurant’s story and ambience, and easily find important details such as opening hours, contact information, and location. The design will be clean, responsive, and easy to navigate, giving customers a pleasant experience that reflects the warm and welcoming atmosphere of Rikaapi.
